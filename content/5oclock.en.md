### A game about spoon wars!

This is a multiplayer last team standing game. There are 4 teams with 2 players in each. Team with the last player alive wins.

Also this is my first online multiplayer project, so it's a bit broken.

And yes, it has skins: ![some skins](/images/5oclock/skins.png)

Controls:
WASD or Arrow Keys

Mobile controls:
Left/Right halfs of the screen to move. Arrow button to jump.
